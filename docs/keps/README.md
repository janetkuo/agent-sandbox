# Agent Sandbox Enhancement Proposals

In agent-sandbox, we follow a process inspired by the official [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP)](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps) process to propose, communicate, and coordinate on new efforts for the project.

## Quick Start

Follow the process outlined in the [template](NNNN-template/README.md) to create your proposal. Before writing the proposal, you can socialize your ideas by reaching the maintainers and other contributors on the [#sig-apps channel on Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-apps) or the [SIG-Apps mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/sig-apps).

## FAQs

### When should I follow the process?

It's best for most non-trivial changes. Specifically:

*   Anything that may be controversial
*   Most new features (except for the very smallest)
*   Major changes to existing features
*   Changes that have a wide-ranging impact on the project

### How are KEPs numbered?

KEPs are prefixed with their associated tracking issue number from the `agent-sandbox` repository. This gives each KEP a unique identifier and makes it easy to find the issue where the current state of the proposal is being discussed and updated.

### Why should I write an KEP?

The goal of the KEP process is to clearly communicate new efforts to the `agent-sandbox` community. By creating a well-curated set of proposals, we can:

*   Provide a clear record of the decisions that have been made.
*   Ensure that the community has a chance to review and provide feedback on major changes.
*   Make it easier for everyone to find information about the current state and future direction of the project.
